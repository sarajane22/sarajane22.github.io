            <h2>The Rule, Not the Exception: Why Fiction Novels Disappoint Us In the End and Why That Isn't Such A Bad Thing</h2>
            <p class="description">With this blog post, I take the reader through the different stipulations of fiction novels and how they may set specific expectations for real life. I explore how these expectations may lead to some disappointment in real life...but also how these disappointments may have a side to them that don't necessarily make the experience negative.

            <h2>Cancel Culture: The Permanent Repercussions </h2>
            <p class="description">In this few minute discussion, the idea of cancel culture and how the "rules" of this concept changes depending on the setting, such as the societal perception for a 'celebrity' in comparison to a college student. With this short podcast, we investigate the common misconceptions and miscommunications cancel culture encourages in our modern day world, as well as the negative aftermath such a concept stimulates behind the scenes.  <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/3m7aL">Check it out!</a></p>

          <h2>The Life of a Legacy</h2>
          <p class="description">
          This video is short and sweet, yes, but it gives the audience a taste of the beauty I'm blessed with being surrounded by. This video is less about my life and more about the wonder I feel at experiencing the same pleasentires my family was able to the generation before me. It isn't perfect, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. Come on the journey with <a href="..."me. </p>
